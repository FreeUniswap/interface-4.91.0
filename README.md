# Free Interface for Uniswap Protocol

Uniswap labs began charging fees for using its interface in October 2023. This is a free version of an older interface (August 2022) that allows you to use the Uniswap protocol without paying fees.

## Changes in the interface

We have made some changes to the original interface to adapt it to open use, improving privacy:

- Blocked addresses and tokens have been removed
- Google analytics has been removed
- Amplitude analytics has been removed
- Removed wallet provider Fortmatic, which also collects user data
- Uniswap protocol governance access has been removed
- Links to Uniswap Labs legal notices and terms of use have been removed
- Links to user services provided by Uniswap Labs have been removed
- Colors have been changed to distinguish it from the official interface
- Automatic translation to the browser language has been removed as the translations are of poor quality and many users complained about this aspect. It is now optional to activate the interface translation.
- The transaction router always runs on the client side
- Deprecated Ethereum testnets have been removed

This version of the interface predates the deployment of the Uniswap universal router and does not include support for NFTs. It only allows swaps and liquidity management in Uniswap V2 and V3.
